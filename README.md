# smart-sleep-screen-health-analysis
This research project investigates the relationship between screen exposure patterns and sleep health using machine learning and data analytics techniques. The study involves preprocessing sleep and screen-time datasets, performing exploratory analysis and applying predictive modelling to identify correlations affecting sleep quality. The project strengthened my understanding of research-oriented machine learning workflows, data interpretation and visual communication of analytical findings.


# Smart Sleep & Screen Health Analysis
